## Job layoff prediction classification models:

---

This Repository contains code files and datasets that we have used for building a classification model for Job layoff prediction.


**Project Overview:**

**Objective**: Build and Evaluate • Random Forest (RF)
• XGBoost (XGB) Models for job layoff class prediction ("layoff" = 1,0 where 1 means yes and 0 means No death event.)

**Description**:

1. Data Source: for this project we have create our dataset
2. Data visulization: count plots, heatmap, pie chart etc.
3. Model Building and hypertuning:
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using accuracy score, AUC-ROC, confusion matrix, classification report.
